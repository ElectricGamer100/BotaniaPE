This code is open source.

The only part of this code I do not have a say over is Ksymc's
Header files, which are used here.

~Thanks~
To: - SliceOfCode - I learned how to make a derived class from you, and to double check licenses on code before I post on github :P
	- Byteandahalf - Showing the use of your BrewingStand tile renderer, I figured out how to do Tessellation from that
	- ElectricGamer - For telling me things you figured out while we learned.
	- DAW330073 - for exchanging info as we learned.
	- MCPEGamer04 - for actully teaching me where to get started in Addons.
