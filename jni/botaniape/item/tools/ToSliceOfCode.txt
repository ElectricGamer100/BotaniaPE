If you are reading this then, HA! I knew you would check here.
If not then I am crazy.

Anyways, I am sorry for not realizing that your code wasn't open 
source, and for posting it on Github, yes I did copy/past that part
No I did not Intend to keep it, I have a new (terrible/crashing) WIP class. 
Now will you stop having my phone notifications go off? I do have a life (a lie) you know. :P

~P.S. I am full aware of the stress of people copying code,
 I was just experimenting.
